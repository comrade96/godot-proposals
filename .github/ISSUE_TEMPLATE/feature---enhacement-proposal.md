**Describe the project you are working on:** I am working on a project which is based on a simple Air Hockey style theme.

**Describe the problem or limitation you are having in your project:** So in my project there are 4 major charectors. 1.The Players(Kinematic Body) ,2.The Puck(RigidBody) and 3.The Walls (static body). So when the players or i mean KinematicBody2D ,the puck and the wall are close enough the puck goes through the wall. There are some tutorial where they insist to turnoff the INFINITE INERTIA off. But having done that the problem still remains.

**Describe how this feature / enhancement will help you overcome this problem or limitation:** maiking the engine default settings to deal with the tunneling would be a great things for situtaion like this and i think it will be also helpful for many other projects

**Show a mock up screenshots/video or a flow diagram explaining how your proposal will work:** MAKING INFINITE INERTIA A PROPERTY OF rigidbody2D AND MAKE IT VISIBLE TO THE INSPECTOR. OR ANY OTHER WAY SO THAT IT HELPS US TO DEAL WITH THE TUNNELING OR BODIES GOING THROUGH COLLIDERS! 

**Describe implementation detail for your proposal (in code), if possible:**

**If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?:** i think this is a issue which is a very difficult to deal with . Sometimes it works on somekind of game and sometimes it doesnt. So making tunneling off in the first place should be a great thing.

**Is there a reason why this should be core and not an add-on in the asset library?:** I already mentioned it. But as i say problem of tunneling is different in diffreent projects and the solutions are also different. If someone comes to a way where he cant find any tutorial or answer it is realy hard to fix this.
